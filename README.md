# dotbits

> *unsigned int -> Vec\<bool\>, plus helper functions*

dotbits is a rust library that simplifies bit manipulation. Its primary feature is the `.bits()` function, which converts any unsigned integer type (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`) into a `Vec<bool>`. It also adds certain helper functions over `Vec<bool>`.
